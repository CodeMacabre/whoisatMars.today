[WhoIsAtMarsToday?](https://whoisatmarstoday.netlify.com) is a web app built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), listing the robots (and eventually humans) currently on the surface of, and on orbit around, Mars. Currently updated manually, WhoIsAtMarsToday? will eventually be automatically-updated.

This is a work-in-progress, inspired by [How Many People Are In Space Right Now?](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/)
