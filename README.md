# whoisatMars.today?

## Overview
[whoisatMars.today](https://whoisatmars.today) is a website built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), listing the robots (and eventually humans) currently on the surface of, and on orbit around, Mars. Currently updated manually, whoisatMars.today will eventually be automatically-updated.

This is a work-in-progress, inspired by [howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/).
